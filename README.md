## **Requirement Brief**

This is an SPA, which supplys takeout service. Customers can see the menu and select their favorite foods.

They can select at most 1 of each kind of food to make up a set meal. For example, they can select 1 dish of fires, 1 dish of burger and 1 cup of latte.

As they select or deselect food, the price will be re-calculated and refreshed on the bottom of page.

What they have already selected will be shown.


## **State Management Design**

According to the requirement and UI/UX design, the state should include: 3 kinds of food, shop infomation, and customer infomation.

The actions to access state should at least include: add food, remove food, calculate total price, get shop info.

This part is implemented by [Redux](https://www.redux.org.cn/).

## **Component Design**

According to the UI/UX design, the page should at least contain: navigation bar, menu, order, shop infomation, bottom bar.

Except the Menu component is implemented by [Carousel of Ant Design](https://ant-design.antgroup.com/components/carousel-cn) for efficiency, the others are implemented by native Javascript and Html.
